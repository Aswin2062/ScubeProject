      "Many institutional investors want to increase the environmental and social impact of their portfolio, but struggle to find investment opportunities – typically because they are too small.  <br />                                          Impactable Investment Group is designing institutional scale solutions to overcome these challenges. We believe that investment aggregation is a helpful method for investors seeking to access financial-first, private market impact investments. This can benefit from lower risk through diversification, lower costs through scale, and improved return and impact through greater access.    <br />                                                                             Impactable is currently focused on private debt and private equity investment opportunities in Emerging Markets (EM) that generate significant returns, whilst also addressing significant challenges for people at the bottom of the pyramid.",
